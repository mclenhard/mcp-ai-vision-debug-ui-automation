[![MCP Server](https://img.shields.io/badge/MCP-Visual%20UI%20Debug-blue)](https://github.com/samihalawa/visual-ui-debug-agent-mcp) [![GLAMA Compatible](https://img.shields.io/badge/GLAMA-Compatible-green)](https://github.com/samihalawa/visual-ui-debug-agent-mcp) [![Smithery Compatible](https://img.shields.io/badge/Smithery-Compatible-orange)](https://smithery.ai/docs/config)

An autonomous debugging MCP server that empowers AI models to analyze, debug, and interact with web interfaces through Playwright. This server enables any AI model (even those without built-in vision capabilities) to visually inspect web pages, find UI bugs, test user workflows, and validate application performance - all without human intervention.

## Autonomous UI Debugging Agent

This MCP server functions as an AI-powered autonomous debugging agent that can:

- **Perform comprehensive visual analysis** of web applications
- **Detect UI issues** by inspecting visual elements and their properties
- **Automatically test common user workflows** without manual test script creation
- **Validate API endpoints** and verify backend responses
- **Track visual changes** between application versions
- **Monitor console logs** for errors and warnings
- **Analyze performance metrics** to identify bottlenecks
- **Generate detailed reports** with screenshots and recommendations

The server is designed to work intelligently, reusing browser sessions, avoiding unnecessary file creation, and focusing on the most important aspects of your application.

// 1. Analyze the current version
const currentAnalysis = await mcp.callTool("enhanced_page_analyzer", {...});

// 2. Compare with previous version
const comparisonResult = await mcp.callTool("visual_comparison", {...});

// 3. Generate visual difference report
const report = await mcp.callTool("ui_workflow_validator", {...});
```

### End-to-End User Flow Validation
```javascript
// 1. Start with login flow
const loginResult = await mcp.callTool("ui_workflow_validator", {...});

// 2. Validate core features
const featureResults = await mcp.callTool("navigation_flow_validator", {...});

// 3. Test API endpoints
const apiResults = await mcp.callTool("api_endpoint_tester", {...});
```

### Performance Optimization
```javascript
// 1. Analyze initial performance
const initialPerformance = await mcp.callTool("performance_analysis", {...});

// 2. Identify slow-loading elements
const elementPerformance = await mcp.callTool("dom_inspector", {...});

// 3. Monitor console for errors
const consoleErrors = await mcp.callTool("console_monitor", {...});
```

// The model receives structured data about visual elements
{
  "interactiveElements": [
    {
      "tagName": "button",
      "text": "Submit",
      "bounds": {"x": 120, "y": 240, "width": 100, "height": 40},
      "visible": true
    },
    // More elements...
  ]
}
```

## CI/CD Integration

This MCP server includes GitHub Actions workflows for continuous integration and deployment:

## Running evals

The evals package loads an mcp client that then runs the index.ts file, so there is no need to rebuild between tests. You can load environment variables by prefixing the npx command. Full documentation can be found [here](https://www.mcpevals.io/docs).

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key  npx mcp-eval src/evals/evals.ts src/index copy.ts
```
